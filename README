= Unobtrusive Upload Progress for Rails with Mongrel

Upload progress is messy and often doesn't handle validations very
well.  This plugin aims to provide a transparent way to add upload
progress to your forms by only adding an extra HTML class to a form
tag.


== Installation

This code is packaged as a Rails plugin;

  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/remvee/unobtrusive_upload_progress.git

The installation hook will copy a JavaScript file into your
+public/javascripts+ directory.  I'll need to include it in your views
using +javascript_include_tag+ or something simular.

After installing the plugin you'll need to setup a Mongrel
configuration script to add the following +uri+ mappings:

  uri '/', :handler => ::UploadProgress::MonitorHandler.new, :in_front => true
  uri '/upload_progress', :handler => ::UploadProgress::StatusHandler.new

The first will sit before all request to Rails actions and record
upload progress when a request comes by which includes the +upload_id+
parameter in the query-string (on the URL).  The other handler will
provide the status of a given +upload_id+ in JSON format.


== Layout

Add the following to the head section of HTML in your layouts:

  <%= javascript_include_tag 'upload_progress' if UploadProgress.monitor_loaded? %>


== Forms

Simply add the "upload_progress" class to the forms you want to have
upload progress.  Note the progress bar will kick in when the submit
takes longer than 2 seconds.
